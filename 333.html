<H4>Primary Goal: 
</H4>
<P>To automate as much of the pre-Conference coordination and work
for the Princeton Model United Nations Conference as possible,
especially coordination between the Conference Managers and the
Conference Attendees. 
</P>
<H4>Overview:
</H4>
<P>For our project, we will be redesigning the website and conference
management software for the Princeton Model United Nations Conference
(PMUNC). The current PMUNC website provides basic management features
for the conference, however as the conference has grown to over 1250
participants, the need for a full redesign to implement some
fundamentally new features has become evident. 
</P>
<P>Every year, PMUNC is attended by 30-50 schools, each with 5-70
delegates. Princeton staffs the Conference with about 100-125
University students. The Conference is divided into 20 committees,
each with different agendas and topics of discussion. Delegates and
staff members are assigned to one of the 20. The conference lasts
four days, meaning lodging and food need to be coordinated in
advance. From this arises a need for a sophisticated database driven
web application to manage all the various aspects of the conference
throughout the 5 month period from the opening of registration to the
conclusion of the conference. Also, as this conference is the primary
source of income for the Princeton University International Relations
Council, high production quality, reliability, and appealing design
are all needed. 
</P>
<P>Major aspects of the conference to be managed by the website: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI> Display of informational content
	about the conference 
	<LI> School registration - creation of
	Faculty Adviser (FA) accounts 
	<LI> Individual committee pages with
	topical background information 
	<LI> Assignment of delegates into
	committees 
	<LI> Individual delegate accounts 
	<LI> FA management of their delegates
	and progress 
	<LI> Applications to selective
	committees 
	<LI> Basic staff/role management -
	individual staff accounts with variable privileges 
	<LI> Rooming assignments 
</UL>
<P>The primary enhancements over the previous PMUNC web application
will be functionality at the individual delegate level. The previous
website did not have accounts for each delegate, only each school.
Without knowledge of each delegate, functionality such as committee
assignments and rooming assignments had to be handled by spreadsheets
sent via email. One of the aims of this project is to eliminate the
need for this. 
</P>
<H4>User Scenarios:
</H4>
<H5>Faculty Advisor - Registration: 
</H5>
<P>User arrives at the index page, which is designed to market PMUNC
as effectively as possible. Should include photos from previous
conferences, and possibly testimonials. Welcome letter from Charge
d'Affaires directs user to FAQ and further conference information
like time line, fees, etc. After user decides that s/he wishes to
register for PMUNC, they follow a navigation link to the registration
form. Information such as school name, contact info, desired user
name/password, number of spots requested is submitted. Input is
validated and confirmed. User receives email confirmation of the
received registration. After being reviewed by Conference Management
(CM), user receives confirmation of official registration and an
invoice for payment (automatic generation of invoice is a reach
feature). 
</P>
<H5>Faculty Advisor - Delegate Management: 
</H5>
<P>N.B. - The actions taken here are likely to take place over
several sessions. However, there is no reason it could not occur in a
single session, and it is presented as such for brevity. 
</P>
<P>User arrives at the index page, and clicks the log-on link. After
logging on, user is taken to the FA home page, where the latest
announcements from CM are displayed. User clicks on &quot;Delegate
Management.&quot; The delegate view grid is empty. User decides to
enter his/her delegate list into the web site. User is only required
to provide the name of the delegate (and optionally email), from
which a user name, and initial password is automatically generated.
The remainder of required information about each delegate is likely
to be inputted by each delegate at initial log-on. However, user may
also provide this information at initialization of the account by
switching to a separate view. This information includes: grade,
contact information, partner (if applicable), committee assignment,
rooming assignment. Reach feature: Write a script that will take a
.csv file outputted by MS Excel and update the information in the
database with the values in the .csv file. User will be given
instructions on how to format the Excel file and how to save as a
.csv file. 
</P>
<P>Upon completion, user is presented with a link to a printable
version of the delegate list, containing delegate names, usernames,
and passwords. Additionally, if the user provided email addresses for
the delegates, a single-click will send out an email to all users
with their individual user name and password. 
</P>
<P>After the entire delegate list has been entered into the database,
the user may now view his/her entire delegate list, and make edits as
necessary by clicking an edit button next to the delegates name. 
</P>
<P>From here, the user clicks on the &quot;Committee Assignments&quot;
tab of the Delegate Management view. The user is presented with a
two-pane view. In the bottom pane, the user is presented with the
list of all positions s/he has been given by CM. In our case, the
user has been assigned the Canadian and Brazilian delegations to the
UN committees, and 3 spots on specialized committees In the top pane,
the delegate list appears, with only the name field showing. If a
delegate has a partner, both names appear on a single line. There are
two drop-down menus: committee and position. User selects the
committee to which they wish to assign the delegate to. If only one
position exists for that committee, it is automatically selected. If
not, the user selects which of the positions on that committee to
which to assign the delegate (in our case, likely Canada or Brazil).
After completing this, the user presses submit to have the
information updated. (Reach feature: Use the same script mentioned
previous to accept .csv input. Also, output a template .csv file
based upon the given assignments to be filled in). 
</P>
<H5>Student - Setup and Viewing Committee Info: 
</H5>
<P>User has received user name and password either directly from the
website via email, or from his/her FA via the print out. User arrives
at the index page and clicks log-in to log in to the site. Upon
logging in, he is taken to the Delegate home page, displaying the
latest announcements, and relevant links to necessary downloadable
documents (Delegate Guide, Rules of Procedure, Code of Conduct,
etc.), as well as his/her committee page. If this user's profile
information is incomplete (contact info, etc.), s/he is prompted to
update it by clicking the Edit Profile button. After filling in all
the requisite information, the user downloads each of the conference
documents to read later. User now clicks on the link to his committee
page. 
</P>
<P>Committee view contains the name of the committee, the topics for
the committee, if applicable, as well as a welcome letter from the
Chair. User then clicks on the link for the committee Background
Guide (BG), which downloads as a PDF. After reading the BG, user then
writes his/her position paper in the word processor of his/her
choice. Upon completion, user returns to the Delegate home page to
upload his/her position paper. File name is validated to end in:
.rtf, .doc, or .pdf. Users submitting .docx files receive a
particularly bitter error message, while users submitting .odt files
are given an apologetic error message with a small rant about
monopolies at the end. 
</P>
<H5>Staffer - Selecting Room Assignments:
</H5>
<P>User loads the index page and clicks the log-on button. User logs
in with his Princeton NetID and a temp password created for him/her
by CM. User is then taken to the staff home page where s/he can see
to what role s/he have been assigned by CM. They can also see special
staff announcements in addition to the public announcements User
clicks on the Rooming Assignments tab, and is taken to a list of all
the staff rooms and the current occupants of each. User then clicks
on the room s/he wishes to join. 
</P>
<H4>Architecture: 
</H4>
<P>The website will use the Django web framework, 
MySQL, and the Yahoo! User Interface JavaScript
library. 
</P>
<P>Using Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM) we will define our
data model entirely in Python classes. A basic outline of our object
model is listed below. Note that a * indicates that that field is not
necessary for all instances of the class, and will therefore often be
NULL.

<P>This object model will be accessed using the automatically
generated Django database access API. This enables complete
modularity between our web application and the database, as Django
allows you to simply change which database your application points to
with nothing else in the code being affected. The SQL database
will not be accessed through any other interface. 
</P>
<P>The provided Django admin interface will be used to set up and
initialize the database at the start of each year. Efforts will be
made to add functionality in the web application itself to administer
the conference, however since most of the required functionality is
met reasonably well by Django's administration interface, these will
be low priority. 
</P>
<P>The user interface will be written in a combination of XHTML, CSS
and Javascript using functionality and UI components from YUI. The
Django templating system will be employed to maintain strict
separation between the view and the controller. Additionally, an
inheritance hierarchy of templates will be maintained to minimize
repetition in the markup. An effort will be made to conform to the
XHTML 1.0 Strict specification. This is to ensure complete separation
of the markup and style information. YUI provides some basic CSS
functionality which will be used to ensure uniformity in style across
browsers. The application will be tested in IE6, IE7, and Firefox
2.0. Part of the goal in adhering to standards strictly is for the
site to &quot;work&quot; in other browsers, such as Safari and Opera,
though they will not be tested or officially supported. The YUI Core
will be used to ensure compatibility across browsers in our
JavaScript code. Additionally, several of the UI controls will likely
be used, most notably the DataTable control and the LayoutManager
control. 
</P>
<P>We will use the exiting server of the International Relations
Council to host our website, though we will be completely
reformatting the system. We will run Apache with mod_python on a
Linux system, either Ubuntu 7.10 Server Edition or a more customized
Gentoo build, if time permits. We will also use this machine to host 
our SVN server. 
</P>
<H4>Milestones: 
</H4>
<UL>
	<LI> Before Spring Break (3-14) - Server set-up: Linux, Apache,
    and SVN installation.
	<LI> End of Spring Break (3-22) - Data model and basic site
	organization complete. Database configured. Create first draft 
of
    CSS templates and basic site layout.
	<LI> First TA Meeting - Basic manipulation of data model through
    browser. Beginnings of session management. Start work on JS 
controls.
</UL>
<P> After our first TA meeting we will use the advice of our TA to
determine the timing of the remainder of these milestones:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI> Complete session management, including management of 
privileges 
	<LI> Completion of server-side code for delegate management
    <LI> Completion of server-side code for staff management
	<LI> Complete JavaScript controls and client-side functionality
	<LI> Finalize markup and page layout
	<LI> Completion of site design (CSS and graphics)
	<LI> Final testing
</UL>
<H4>Risks and Open Issues: 
</H4>
<P>None of us have very significant web development experience,
though we have some familiarity with web technologies. Also, none of
us have ever used Python or Django, and only a few of us has done
significant JavaScript coding. Therefore there will be a HUGE
learning curve initially. There is the chance that we won't grok all
the required technologies quickly enough to finish the project. 
</P>
<P>Also, while our data model is pretty simple and straightforward,
there are large number of different features and views that have to
be implemented. Depending on how efficient we eventually get, we may
not be able to complete all of the required functionality for the
site. 
</P>
<P>Fortunately, because we have our own server that we are allowed to
administer, we are unlikely to run into any blocks on the logistical
side of things. All the software we intend to use is free open source
software. 
</P>
<H4>Reach Features: 
</H4>
<UL>
	<LI> Awards management - allow Chairs to view delegate list for
    their committees and indicate who has won awards. Then merge winners
    into MS Word certificate template (likely will be able to 
implement).
	<LI> Badges management - merge full delegate list into MS Word 
badge template
    (likely will be able to implement)
	<LI> Research links generated from topic name 
	<LI> Allow delegates to list committee
	preferences, and provide FAs with an option to auto-assign 
delegates
	to positions using a matching algorithm 
	<LI> AJAX functionality - doesn't seem
	necessary now, though I'm sure we can invent a use for it. 
Interactively
    editble data table control perhaps?
	<LI> Committee roll call for use during the conference, allow 
FAs
	to see which delegates skipped committee from a web interface
