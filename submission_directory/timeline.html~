    <h2>COS 333 Project Timeline</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>March 16, 2012</dt>
    <dd>First official meeting. We met in Frist to discuss and draft the first version of the project description document.</dd>
    <dt>March 21, 2012</dt>
    <dd>Set up repository on github. Set up ec2 instance.</dd>
    <dt>March 22, 2012</dt>
    <dd>First iteration of model: MySQL tables that look like <a href="models1.html">this</a></dd>
    <dt>April 2, 2012</dt>
    <dd>Pietro wrote Python functions to update MySQL database.</dd>
    <dt>April 9, 2012</dt>
    <dd>Alice wrote first "fully-functional" backend in python with bottle, opting to save json arrays to flat files instead of using MySQL. Decided to split front-end back-end so we don't step on eachothers' toes. <a href="API1.html">API</a></dd>
    <dt>April 25, 2012</dt>
    <dd>Switched to using an Elastic IP address so we can attach domain names. Adapted back-end to run on Apache so that it runs persistently. Integrated authentication into back-end code and API (added auth.json to store email/userid/hashed-password mappings, required signatures and tokens from client). Wrote client.py as a simple test client that presents credentials and sometimes is not authorized to perform functions.  Struggled and failed to set up SSL connections. Sort of got SSL working with a CherryPy adapter, but only for self-signed certificates and only between two Python programs.</dd>
    <dt>May 4, 2012</dt>
    <dd>Added function get_self, added phone to user object, added is_modified function. Added get_my_events and get_my_invitations. Added a check if email already exists in system in create_user. Added a method called find_users that returns a list of users that match the query (takes separate parameters for name, phone number, email, list of ids of friends they might be friends with)</dd>
<dt>May 5, 2012</dt>
<dd>Registered for us the domain name ZTBINMIYOG.US and successfully attached the SSL certificate. Still need to figure out Apache adapter for HTTPS connections. Got a Twilio account for us, having problems with authentication with their API.</dd>
<dt>May 7, 2012</dt>
<dd>Changed get_friends, get_guests, and find_users to consistently return dictionaries of id to user mappings. Changed remove_event to work (fixed removal of eventids in user events list)</dd>
<dt>May 8, 2012</dt>
<dd>Standardized our error-checking. Rewrote database so every id is a string. Deleted deprecated functions and added search_users, which takes a single parameter q that can be a phone number, email, anything. Current versions of <a href="API2.html">API</a>, <a href="eventsjson.html">events</a>, <a href="usersjson.html">users</a>, and <a href="authjson.html">authentication</a> documents.</dd>
<dt>May 9, 2012</dt>
<dd>Made us a logo, splashpage, etc.</dd>
<dt>May 10, 2012</dt>
<dd>Registered for us the domain name glue-app.info as our product page and modified the server so it would serve static files and html so I can get started making the product page.</dd>
