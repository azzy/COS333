<h2>Elevator Speech</h2>
    <p>
      Despite being connected to hundreds of friends on Facebook, many people report feeling isolated. Asking friends to spend time with you one by one (via phone, SMS, e-mail, etc...) is feasible but it is painfully slow and cumbersome. Our system is designed to make it easy for people to send open invitations to their close group of friends: &ldquo;I will be working out in Dillon Gym from 3-4pm today. Click here to join me&rdquo;. Our system is for people who don&#39;t want to crowd their friends&#39; inboxes with requests to hang out and don&#39;t want to organize large events, but who would like to have some company while they&#39;re working, going to the gym, or making dinner. We want to solve the problem of spontaneous gatherings using new mobile technologies.</p>
<h2>How to Access a Running Version of the System</h2>
<p>We will give you an iPhone with the application installed so that you can test it out. The source code is also available <a href="https://github.com/azzy/COS333">on github</a>. Note that if we actually deploy the application, we will change all secret keys and functions from those in the public versions to prevent hackability.</p>

<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:prea@princeton.edu">prea@princeton.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:azheng@princeton.edu">azheng@princeton.edu</a> if something goes terribly wrong.</p>
