	 get_users, get_user, create_user, get_events, find_users
Requires token:
	 get_auth, get_self, update_user, get_friends, add_friend, 
	 add_friends, remove_friend, remove_friends, is_modified,
	 get_my_invitations, get_my_events, 
	 get_event, create_event, update_event, remove_event, 
	 get_guests, add_guest, add_guests, remove_guest, remove_guests,

Please let me know if you think that security levels should change
in any way or that we are missing some functions.

Note that as a general rule, the following are returned in the case
of errors encountered in any of these:
"Authentication Failed"
"Event does not exist"
"User does not exist"
"User already exists"
